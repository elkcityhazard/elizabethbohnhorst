Past guest-editors were Chris Ujine Ong and Gwee Li Sui, a poet and graphic artist. SOFTBLOW has been a home for contemporary poetry from all over the world since Sep. 2004. We strive to focus the eye back on the poem. This journal does not pretend to exist for a general reading audience. It is for unswerving lovers of poetry who also appreciate how far poetry has come over time."

    "description": "Structure and Style was born out of a desire to not just post our favorite poems but to also be able to talk about poetry. To start a dialogue. Poetry isn’t dying, but it could always use a few more fans. We’ve been around since July 2011, since we took what was a friendship based on being undergraduate classmates and joined forces to tell you about poems we love."
